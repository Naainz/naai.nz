## Me

My name is Stefan, but I usually go by _Naainz_ online. I'm an emerging frontend web developer, who loves to explore new technologies and discover more skills. Currently, I'm focusing on web development with Astro.js, exploring different web frameworks through various projects. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, creating art, and watching TV shows.

## Why this exists

I'm not usually the type to spill the beans about my thoughts on personal or political stuff, but I do enjoy talking about technology. Adding a blog to my site gives me a platform to share my thoughts and experiences with others, even if this ends up with no one reading them. I also hope that this will help me improve my writing skills.

## My goals in the industry

One of my goals as a developer is to contribute to the open-source community. I hope to participate in other projects and create my own open-source software that people will find useful. It's a rewarding feeling to be able to give back to the community that has taught me so much.

I'm also interested in game development. I've played around with the Godot Engine in the past, and I hope to revisit this in the future to create my own games.

## What I'll be writing about

For this 'blog', you can expect me to talk a lot about tech, and the occasional: giving free coding tutorials and advice. Since I'm still in the early stages of my journey, I'll be writing mostly about my learning experiences and progress with my projects.
